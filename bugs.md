Can’t edit the time in adding a game seems like it doesnt allow editing in the app version

The coach name is hard to click (multiple times clicked until selected) when adding a training from the court calendar
(here Im suggesting making new UI entirely for adding an event or making a new event , both for the hours and for the trainers and teams picking , the only thing that shall not be changed is picking if its training or game since I want a design that would be more bug free)

when deleting an event
Doesn’t really delete an event + after confirming deleting it takes me to a whole different page
